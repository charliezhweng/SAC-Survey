# SAC-Survey

README

This is a data analysis project I worked on as an Assessment Intern during Fall 2018. In this project, I explored the results of a survey I gave out to guests at my university's Student Activities Center. Using these results and feedback from the guests, I was able to explore trends and data using Python. Included in this Jupyter Notebook file are results of the survey, charts derived from the data and analysis for the future improvements on services and amenities for the Student Activities Center.
